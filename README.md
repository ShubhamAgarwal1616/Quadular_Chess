### Domain:
The colored squares on which pieces are positioned at start of game represents a domain. A domain is not active if pieces are not set up on it while start of game in case of 2-3 players.

## Game Instructions:

- You can play this game 2-4 players. Each player needs to capture the king of all his opponents to win the game.
- Checkmating and Castling is not allowed, a player needs to kill his king to knock him out of game. 
- EnPassant is allowed as usual.
- Only `King` can move in and out of Throne freely, other pieces can only capture his opponent piece inside the throne.
- If a player's `King` gets killed, and he has a `Young King` on his side then his `Young King` is replaced with `King` and game continues. Otherwise, the player is out of the game.
- When a player captures his opponent `King` and his opponent has no `Young King` available on the board, the player gets to control his opponent pieces as his own, but he can not promote his opponents `Prince` or `Pawn`.
- A player is knocked out of game if his timer expires but his pieces are then not controlled by any other player. They just sit idle on the board and other players can capture them.
- No Piece can jump over other piece or kill their own ally pieces.
